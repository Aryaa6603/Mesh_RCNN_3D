# Mesh_RCNN_3D
3D Object Detection and Reconstruction

Mesh R-CNN is a system that improves 3D shape prediction. 
 It's an extension of the 2D instance segmentation system, Mask R-CNN. Mesh R-CNN adds a mesh prediction branch to Mask R-CNN. 
 This branch outputs meshes with different topological structures
